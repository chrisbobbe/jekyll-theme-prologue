Hello!

Hope you are doing great! I'm Dhananjey, a 24 year old male studying MSc in materials sciences at the UZH. I originally come from the city of Madras, India and I moved to zurich for my master's degree last year. My current housing contract will soon come to an end, hence I'm looking out for rooms. I found your ad on Ron Orp. 

A few things about myself; I love to do some yoga and from time to time hit the gym, I have been a bit into photography lately so I'm going around the city on the weekends to shoot some light :) I love watching movies, movies of all kinds, and most importantly cooking! You can definitely see that when I'm in the kitchen :) I like to hang out with the people I live with, an active communtiy life, but at the same time respect their privacy and space. I like to be sustainable, so I'm a vegetarian and I like to grow my own spices and herbs which I'm looking forward to doing this summer after many many years. I have the WG experience (WOKO) of living with 6 other people in my current apartment in zurich for one year now, so I'm confident that I can blend in with a new bunch of people. My housing situation is kinda terrible at the moment, it would be great if you could kindly let me know your thoughts :)

Have a nice day!

Best 
Dhananjey

Hey Naoki 

Thank you very much for your response. Yes, I'll be staying back for my PhD in Zurich. I currently have a job as a business development assistant in Zurich, so that will also keep me around here :) 

I would be happy to hear your thoughts. I'll be having my current place until mid of September. I would like to get something permanent and I prefer not to settle down on this temporary place which I have been offered (got to give them an answer by this weekend and the place is only till the end of October) Is it possible to set up a meeting with you guys in the next couple of days? Please let me know :)

Best 

Dhananjey
