Hi Naoki, 



I am a 26-year old, male American graduate student reaching out to you because of my interest in living in your open residential community from the summer of 2020 onwards for a duration of about 2 years. The main reason I would be coming to Switzerland is to pursue a MSc in Neural Systems and Computing at UZH. My motivation for this program is my father who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2001. Working in the field of neuroscience to develop cutting-edge technology in diagnostics and therapy is very interesting to me. Currently, I am taking graduate coursework in the biomedical sciences in New Jersey, USA to prepare for the program in 2020. Up until now, I have worked in variety of healthcare settings (emergency, psychiatric and surgery departments in hospitals). My experiences have allowed me to intertwine mindfulness with empathy in my day-to-day interactions with fellow co-workers, patients and their families. 



Although I was born in the US, I am from a Sri Lankan Buddhist background. Frequenting the Buddhist temple has been an important part of my life since childhood. We offer dana (alms-giving) to the Buddhist monks, discuss teachings with them and participate in group meditation sessions. Companionship with the monks has always made my state of mind more simple and humble when facing the stress of today's hectic life. In addition, the Sri Lankan cuisine we cook at home is for the most part vegetarian (occasionally we eat fish but I can do without it) and very healthy. My mom could write you a cookbook! I have worked in a Sri Lankan restaurant in New Jersey called Sigiri during my university years, if you are seeking another cook in the kitchen. 



Fitness is also an important theme in my life. Going on runs, strength training, swimming, cycling, playing tennis, doing yoga are some of the activities I like to partake in. It allows me to relieve stress and feel good. 



I believe the communal lifestyle you and the others are living will be conducive to my studies and I would love to contribute in any way possible to make life simpler and easier for you all. Living with loving kindness (metta) is a sure guarantee to happiness no matter what life throws at you. 



You can find me on Whatsapp and Facebook to chat more! 



Regards, 

Eranda
