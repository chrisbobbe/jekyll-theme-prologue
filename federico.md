Hi beautiful people! 

I'm a postdoc at ETH working on the Amazon conservation. New in town, I'm 29, Italian. I've been living my last 5 years in Norway in a 8 people rural community (with bees, vegetable garden, chickens, pizza oven etc.). We used to host one jam session a month and organize a yearly festival. In other words, I love to share a bit more than in usual collectives! I like to spend most of my time doing research, playing capoeira and classical guitar. I'm environmentalist, left wing and vegetarian, and I like to live up to my values, but I take few things seriously, I'm playful and very easy to live with! I also love almost all outdoor stuff, especially alpinism and rando skiing. 

I am fluent in english, french and portuguese, and I understand Norwegian and Spanish. 

I'm going to be here for at least 2 years, and I aim to learn german. 

Any chance we can meet and arrange a viewing? 

Thanks!

Hi!

Thanks for the quick response. 

In my previous collective I was cooking once a week for the whole collective, participating in the collective dumpster diving effort, sometimes brewing beer, and for two years I've been in charge of the vegetable garden. If there is a fire oven in the neighborhood I'm happy to call a pizza evening and get out up to 30-40 pizzas in one night. I love to go on the mountains and bring people along, whether it's alpinism hiking or skiing. I love to play music and jam if others are available! I love performance arts, especially capoeira/acrobatic/circus, and I have led a few classes myelf. Very happy to share/replicate any of these! 
I'm starting a new job on Monday and I'm not sure what my schedule will look like. In the past I liked to always spare a couple of hours to chill in the evening, and to be creative in the weekends.

In my ideal apartment we have a quite open house policy to visitors and events, yet in great respect of a good night sleep and all individual needs that might arise over time. Communications runs smooth, and we always assume the best of each others, it saves so much trouble!  A few fundamental things are organized according to clear rules, so that we all have the same expectations, but many are left to spontaneity. I see a great value in living together, because it challenges my habits. I would like to share an apartment in which the standard is a bit more than the minimum common denominator, where things happen, and yet where I feel home, a place I feel comfortable in anytime.

Thanks a lot, and hope to meeting you soon!
