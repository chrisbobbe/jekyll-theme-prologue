Hi Naoki, 



I'm relocating from London to Zurich for a new job in an autonomous driving software company, starting October 1st. I'm looking for a place to live in Zurich and your room and your profile seem ideal. I'd be very grateful if you'd like to discuss this opportunity with me over the phone. 



Thank you, 

Stefano

Thank you for the super quick reply!

I’m a naturally social person, who likes to listen to others and intervene if there is anything interesting to add to the conversation. I live a simple but fulfilling life. I have minimal material possessions, as I value experiences more than stuff.

A typical week day for me would be to get up in the morning, have some breakfast, cycle to work and come back home around 6pm. In the evenings I like to socialise and spend time with friends, ideally by sharing dinner and debating on brain-stimulating topics. I also like the outdoors, and going for a jog once or twice a week is something I’d like to keep doing. Where I live now in London there are plenty of theatre shows and concerts, and I also like the opportunity to relax there.

In Zurich I will be working for a company that develops software for autonomous cars. This is an exciting opportunity for me and I’m looking forward to relocate to your beautiful city and make it become my home. As I won’t have many friends to begin with, I’d like to bond with my housemates, i.e. you. WG is not a new experience for me as this is what I do in London. Not only it makes life more affordable, it allows me to have a fulfilling social life.

I’ve attached a pictures of myself with my family, so that you can associate a face to these words. I’m the guy to the right with the stripy t-shirt. You can find more information about my professional life by following these links:

I’m really looking forward to hear from you soon, although I understand that you’re currently collecting applications. If there is anything else I could provide to help you understand more about me, my character and how I am planning to contribute to your community, please let me know.

Best regards,
Stefano
