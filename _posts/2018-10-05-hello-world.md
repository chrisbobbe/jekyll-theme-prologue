Hi! This is my first post on this personal blog. In accordance with the common practices of coders (also partly due to my momentary lack of creativity): Hello World!

So, if you come to this post from my website, you should already know this: My name is Sitong An - Sitong is the first name. I am a [Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellow](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/) at [CERN](https://home.cern) with the [INSIGHTS](https://www.insights-itn.eu) Project. I am also affiliated with [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) as a PhD student in Experimental High Energy Physics, and the CMS experiment at CERN. I will be working on **Machine Learning for Particle Physics Experiments**.

As I started at CERN only one month ago, I don't have much technical content to write about. However, for the next three years (and even beyond) you could expect more posts about both the technical and personal aspects of my life here, or maybe even just whatever random things that I find interesting.

I will (probably) start with a brief review of the INSIGHTS project - who we are, why we are here and what we are going to work on - and maybe some interesting life stories about me. It is awesome to be part of this project as well as to work here at CERN, and I'm sure during this great adventure in the next three years I will have many good stories to tell here. Stay tuned!
