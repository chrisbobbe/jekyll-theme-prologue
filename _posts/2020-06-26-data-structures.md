<header> <h3> What are data structures? </h3> </header>
<p> Data structure are specialized formats for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. While there are several basic and advanced structure types,
any data structure is efficient in some operations and inefficient in others. Therefore, the goal is to understand them in order to pick the most optimal data structure
for the problem at hand.</p>
<p> Commonly used Data Structures are the following (listed from the easiest to wrap your head around to the hardest in my opinion): 

<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
			<ol>
				<li>Arrays</li>
				<li>Linked Lists</li>
				<li>Stacks</li>
				<li>Queues</li>
				<li>Trees</li>
        <li>Graphs</li>
        <li>Hash Tables</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
