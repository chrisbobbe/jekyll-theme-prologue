This is Prologue, a simple, single page responsive site template from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/prologue), now available as a blog-aware Jekyll theme from [Chris Bobbe](https://chrisbobbe.github.io). It features a clean, minimalistic design and a sticky sidebar with navigation-linked scrolling.

**Demo**: https://chrisbobbe.github.io/jekyll-theme-prologue/

# Added Features

* **Blogging and multi-page features you expect from Jekyll**
* Compatible with GitHub Pages
* **[Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) contact form integration** - just add your email to the `_config.yml` and it works!
* Build your homepage with **custom scrolly sections** in the _sections folder
 * Set a **cover photo** for any section (not just the first), with alt text for screen readers and SEO
* Add your **social profiles** easily in `_config.yml`.
* Automatic search engine optimization (SEO) **meta tags** based on info you provide in `_config.yml` and frontmatter
* **Google Analytics** built-in; just put your [Tracking ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en) in `_config.yml` as `google_analytics`
* Custom **404 page** (called 404.html; to activate, move it to your project directory).

# Installation

There are two ways to get started (choose one):

1. **Install the [jekyll-theme-prologue gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-theme-prologue).** Instructions are in the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#installing-a-theme). After running `bundle install`, you can find the theme files by running `open $(bundle show jekyll-theme-prologue)`.  A sample working `_config.yml` file ships with the gem; if you want to activate it, move it to your project's root directory. It will do nothing until you move it there, replacing the default `_config.yml` file.
2. **Fork or clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue).** If you want to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), create a branch named `gh-pages`, and replace `theme: jekyll-theme-prologue` with `remote_theme: chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue` in the provided `_config.yml` ([GitHub Pages now supports open-source themes on GitHub](https://github.com/blog/2464-use-any-theme-with-github-pages)).

Next, make sure that `url` and `base_url` are set for your own website in `_config.yml`. For local testing, make them both blank. Add a photo avatar to your project, then set `avatar: path/to/your/avatar.jpg` in _config.yml; for example, `avatar: assets/images/avatar.jpg` (48x48 pixels works best). Poke around the sample `_config.yml` file to see how you can add your social profiles.

# Build your homepage

1. **Your `_config.yml` file must include the following line or your homepage won't work**: `collections: [sections]`. This tells Jekyll to look in the _sections folder (which you will create) for your content and render it all on one page.

2. **Create a `_sections` folder** in your project's root directory and start adding content to your homepage. Set a cover photo in any of the sections by adding `cover-photo: path/to/photo.jpg` and `cover-photo-alt: your alt text here` to the section's frontmatter. Sample content is provided in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue/tree/master/_sections).

All new sections should be added as html or Markdown documents in the `_sections` folder. The following section variables can be set with [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/):
- `title` (required)
- `order` (required; orders the sequence of sections on the page. Example: `1`)
- `cover-photo` (optional; sets a background image for the section. Example: `assets/images/banner.jpg`)
- `cover-photo-alt` (required if using a cover photo. Describes the photo for screen readers and SEO; e.g. "Dome of Light art installation, Kaohsiung, Taiwan")
- `icon` (optional; see [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) for icon codes. Example: `fa-github`)
- `icon-style` (optional; "solid" is default, "regular" for outline style icons, or "brands" for logos)
- `auto-header` (optional; "use-title" is default, "none" for no header, or custom header text)
- `hide` (optional; if `true`, the section won't appear)

# Start blogging!

Jekyll has great resources to get you started writing blog posts. Check out [this Jekyll Docs page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) first. When you've written a post or two, copy the following into a new file in your project directory called `blog.html`, and you'll see a link to your blog from the homepage:

```
---
layout: blog
title: My Blog
---
```

-- and that's it!

# Add a page

To add a page, just make a new .html or .md file in your project directory. There's an example called `reading-list` [provided](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue/blob/master/reading-list.md) with the GitHub repository. Add this frontmatter:

```
---
title: My New Page
layout: page
---
```

You can also set these page variables in the frontmatter, if you want:
- `subtitle`
- `order` (orders links in the nav menu, e.g. `1`)
- `icon` (optional; see [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) for icon codes. Example: `fa-github`)
- `icon-style` (optional; "solid" is default, "regular" for outline style icons, or "brands" for logos)
- `hide` (optional; if `true`, a link won't appear in the nav menu. All this does is remove the nav link; your page will still be served to anyone who has the URL.)

**This same set of frontmatter variables (including `title`) can also be set in `index.md` and `blog.html`.** You may want to give them titles, or hide the homepage link with `hide: true` if the homepage is the only page.

For advanced SEO, this theme also lets you add `permalink` (see [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/#where-to-configure-permalinks)), `robots` (string, e.g. "noindex, nofollow"), and `canonical` (boolean; true is default) to any page or post.
