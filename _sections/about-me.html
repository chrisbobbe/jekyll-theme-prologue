<p> Hi, I'm Teo. I graduated with a B.Sc of Honors in Psychology, but my enthusiasm for learning and discipline have lead me to become a self-taught software developer. 
The rapidly changing field of CS turns out to be much better in satisfying my intrinsic thirst for knowledge. </p>
<p>  Having always had a passion for math- mainly calculus, linear algebra and chaos theory, I see CS as a playground where I can let my analytical mind run wild and solve problems creatively. 
  My main focus is on Machine Learning, mainly Deep Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning, as I'm fascinated with how approximations of n-dimensional polynomial functions are able to solve real world problems.</p>
<p> Outside of CS, my interests include music- self-taught pianist and hardcore Bach enthusiast, reading and philosophy. 
 <p> <strong> One of my goals is to be able to carry on Freud's legacy and develop a mathematical way of studying the subconsciouns using ML. </strong> </p>
