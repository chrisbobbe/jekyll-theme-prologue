<p>I'm a junior student at SJTU, passionate about mathematics, stochastic process, statistical arbitrage, machine learning and other topics about quantitative trading. </p>
<p>In my personal life, I'm someone who loves <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/rogerwang__/>food</a>, and also a fan of soccer and tennis. </p>
<p>I'll use this website to share some of my thoughts/ class notes/ research. </p>
