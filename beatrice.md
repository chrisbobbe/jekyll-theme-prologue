Hello! 

My name is Beatrice, I come from Italy and am 24 years old. I read your ad for the room and am really interested in it. 

I finished my Master in physics at ETH in spring and am about to start a Phd in astrophysics (from 1st September) in the same group of my thesis. I have been living in shared apartments for more than five years now and I always loved having people around, getting to know each other and becoming friends, not only people that live together (eating together or going out sometimes would be lovely). I am an open-minded and friendly person, I am clean but not obsessed by cleaning, I donâ€™t smoke and try to live in a healthy and eco-friendly way when I can. I am not exactly a party person, but I really like spending time with friends. 

If you want to know more about me... 

My hometown is Trento, it is located in the Alps in the north east of Italy. I am an only child but grew up with five male cousins and always preferred playing with lego to barbies, I also used to have a dog and love animals in general. I have really enjoyed my stay here in Zurich up to now and am happy to stay another 4 years, I love the city and living abroad is a great opportunity to get to know different ways of living and people from all over the world. I also really like what I am doing, I think looking at the sky and trying to infer something about the Universe is extremely fascinating. I love reading, watching movies, drinking a beer with friends, hiking, singing, theatre, board games, chocolate and travelling. I travel whenever I can and just came back from a 5 months holiday that brought me to Mexico, Ecuador, PerÃ¹, Bolivia and Iceland. I would love to learn new languages: at the moment I am struggling with German and started learning Spanish during my trip to South America. 

I would love to visit the house and get to know you! 

Best, 

Beatrice

Hi,

for me it is really important that a shared apartment is not only to share costs but also to spend time together. In my ideal apartment I would have flatmates that enjoy watching a movie together, having dinner together and spending some time on the weekend together outside the flat.  In everyday life I am obviously out of home most of the day (let's say from 8 to 18 or 20 depending if I do sports on that day). I do my chores in the flat and like it to be at least ok-clean. Sometimes I need time on my own but generally I like sticking around in the flat and chatting with people.

About contributing to the community...I am not entirely sure. In my current wg we mostly helped each other with projects and studying. We had a small terrace garden that we take care of all together and we sometimes get food from restaurants and bakeries to reduce food waste. I would probably first have to see how your community works and then understand where I can help and what I can contribute to ðŸ™‚

Thanks,
Beatrice
